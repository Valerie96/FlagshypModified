Ok so basically 1h_xt works now (since I fixed part of the velcotiy update). 
2h is a bit off, but it doesn't seem to be a damping problem
The x displacement is too small, just slightly. Maybe that's it?

Stress should be uniform accross eleements and it's not
Rerun 1 hex model but cut hex in half b/c that shouldn't change the internal forces

Halved hex model is fine. But adding more nodes does change the kinetic energy. Confirmed in Abaqus. 
But it least it matches Abaqus. Why doesn't the regular sized one match? wtf

Figured it out. The boundary conditions of two nodes were wrong. Except the uncorrected version doesn't work. Too much force

Try doing applied force with two element.
It looks terrible pls help

Ok boundary conditions were skrewed up. Y dof is no longer fixed in applied force
but now something with the reaction force or force calculation is off. The fixed dof are accelerating for some reason


I needed to uptdate external_load_effective after the reaction forces were updated by getForce. And I probably mixed up some +- signs
while trying to fix other things
%step 8 - getForce
  [GLOBAL,updated_PLAST,GEOM.Jn_1,GEOM.VolRate] = getForce_explicit(CON.xlamb,...
          GEOM,MAT,FEM,GLOBAL,CONSTANT,QUADRATURE,PLAST,KINEMATICS,BC,DAMPING,dt);

  GLOBAL.external_load_effective = GLOBAL.external_load + GLOBAL.Reactions;
